LPT: sort queue by longest processing time of stages in q
SPT: sort queue by shortest processing time of stages in q
EDD: sort queue by earliest due date of job in q

loop

(m machines, n jobs, t1 to tn)
for i = 1 to m {
Li < 0 (load on machine i)
J(i) < phi (jobs assigned to machine i)
}

for j=1 to n {
i = argmink Lk (machine i has smallest load)
J(i) <- J(i) union {j} (assign job j to machine i)
Li <- Li + tj (update load of machine i)
return J(1), ..., J(m)
}


need time, machine status
do we need to convert days to time?

Define job as array of job#, stage, release, end, lateness, actual data of stages.

t=0 to start
start_date;

While jobs are in queue or in transit
{

Check date and add available jobs to queue
	What's released by date
	Check what's in transit
Refresh machines (Complete any jobs that are there)
	If jobs are finished, calculate lateness
	Else: toss into transit queue with time it's finished

for each job in queue, check if machine is free. If yes, assign job to machine queue.
	when assigning, store job#, t=expected end

update time to next event (machine is free)
update actual date as well.
	take difference in i

	if (day is Friday){
		if i >= 7.5
			move one day over
	}
	(complicated part of sorting out times from finishing machines)
}



Finally, calculate total percentage of jobs that are late. If lateness exists, increment counter by 1, divide by length of array.

Talk about the central algorithm and how you did it. I suggest drawing an image of the queueing system.
