ASSUMPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Machine only has 80% true capacity (so, 7.5hrs * 80%)
2. One work day (7.5 hour time period during operational hours) is required to transport a job between different machines. In machine time, this is only 6 hours, due to the 80% downtime.
3. Assume holidays are not included.
4. Each machine works 2 shifts of 7.5 hours per day Monday-Thursday, with 1 shift on Friday; this does not account for down time.
5. An operation cannot be preempted; once processing begins on an operation, it cannot be stopped until complete
6. Each machine can work on one, and only one, operation at a time
7. Each job can be processed on one and only one machine at a time
8. Setup times are included in the processing times and they are not sequence-dependent
9. Re-entrant jobs are permitted which means two or more operations of a job may be processed on the same machine
10. If a job is completed on the same day as it is due, there is no lateness incurred.
